# Packages For Days

## What is it?
This is a package manager demonstration that uses directed graphs and depth-first search to identify circular dependencies

## Running and Testing

### Dependencies
- .NET Core SDK 2.x
- NPM (any newer version should do)
- Not Internet Explorer


### Running
```
cd src/PackagesForDays
npm install
dotnet restore
dotnet run
```

### Testing
```
cd src/PackagesForDays.Tests
dotnet test
```

## Misc

My research notes can be found in the Research Folder.

**Chrome/Firefox/Edge recommended.** 

In the interest of time, I have not tested the frontend on older browsers. 

The frontend was optional anyways, so I didn't spend much time on it.
